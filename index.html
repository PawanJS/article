        Oil & gas sector tops FII buying list in July; financial least favoured
      </h2>
      <p class="article">
        Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) remained net buyers for the third
        consecutive month in July, pumping in Rs 2,490.19 crore in the cash
        segment of the Indian market. In contrast, domestic investors booked
        profits to the tune of Rs 10,007.88 crore, their biggest monthly selloff
        in Calendar 2020.
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        After crashing to multi-year lows in March, Indian markets made a smart
        comeback, rising nearly 50 percent in five months on the back of ample
        liquidity injected by central banks across the world in response to the
        coronavirus outbreak, record retail participation and cheap valuations.
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        In July, the 50-share Nifty rose 7.49 percent while the 30-pack Sensex
        logged 7.71 percent gains. The broader markets participated in the rally
        with the Nifty Midcap 100 climbing 5.22 percent and Nifty Smallcap 100
        surging 8.57 percent month-on-month.
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        Of the 35 sectors classified by the BSE, foreign investors were net
        buyers in 14. Seventeen sectors saw outflows and four witnessed no
        action from FIIs in July, data provided by National Securities
        Depository Ltd (NSDL) shows.
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        The oil and gas sector was on the top of FIIs' shopping list, raking in
        Rs 4,230 crore during the month. The sector was among the worst hit in
        the COVID-19-led selloff in March but has since been on FIIs' radar. It
        cornered Rs 7,195 crore of foreign money in the June quarter. Other
        sectors that FIIs bought into include others (Rs 3,508 crore), software
        & services (Rs 2,030 crore), automobiles & auto components (Rs 1,475
        crore), consumer durables (Rs 1,047 crore), pharmaceuticals &
        biotechnology (Rs 970 crore) and insurance (Rs 812 crore) BSE has
        classified around 4,700 issuers into 35 sectors. Any FII investment
        outside these issuers comes under 'others' category.

        The AAI, which works under the Ministry of Civil Aviation, owns and
        manages more than 100 airports across the country. In 2018, the
        government decided to privatise the airports in Lucknow, Ahmedabad,
        Jaipur, Mangaluru, Thiruvananthapuram, and Guwahati. Adani Enterprises
        had won the rights to run these six airports after a competitive bidding
        process in February 2019.

        AGR Hearing Highlights | Will not go into apportionment of resolution
        plan funds between sets of creditors: SC
      </h2>
      <p class="article">
        The Supreme Court (SC) adjourned the hearing in the adjusted gross
        revenue (AGR) case to 2 pm on August 20. A bench led by Justice Arun
        Mishra was hearing the matter pertaining to repayment of adjusted gross
        revenue (AGR) dues by telecom companies.
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        The court had on August 18 said that technicalities would not come in
        the way of enforcing recovery of the AGR dues. The top court had in
        October 2019 upheld the expanded definition of AGR as given by the
        Department of Telecommunications (DoT).

        Nobody's case that spectrum is owned by anyone else other than the
        government. License is merely transfer the right to use, and that right
        involves payments. Spectrum is recorded as an asset, by virtue of having
        been purchased in an auction. Telecom companies own the right to use the
        spectrum, which is an extremely valuable right.. Not seeking to sell the
        spectrum, but only looking to transfer the right to use. Relationship
        between telecom company and the government is akin to relationship
        between landlord and lessor of property. Spectrum can be sold only with
        the DoT nod. It is premature for SC to decide if spectrum can be sold,
        SC should not trouble itself now. If resolution plan succeeds, DoT will
        decide on sale of spectrum at that stage, let government decide. DoT had
        refused to grant nod to Jio-RComm spectrum sale agreement, despite TDSAT
        judgment in favour of RComm. Issue of sale of spectrum is to be decided
        by the DoT. Even possible for UVARC to back out of bid with DOT now
        saying that spectrum sale cant be allowed under IBC. Not the right stage
        for SC to decide the issue of sale of spectrum.
